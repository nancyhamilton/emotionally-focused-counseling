                <p>“Before we worked with Nancy, my wife and I had been struggling for years.  We’ve been married for 18 years and have two great kids who are off to college. We thought “empty nesters” meant we could finally focus on each other and we would magically fall back in love. Well, forget about love—we barely liked each other!  We spent less time together and more time with our friends.  We tried couples counseling but we couldn’t seem to get along unless we were in our therapist’s office.  Nancy’s couples counseling program was different.  She made us both feel comfortable and her unique approach allowed us to look at our relationship from a whole new perspective.  Now our attachment to each other is stronger than ever and our relationship feels easy and playful.  My wife will kill me for saying this but now when our kids come home they tell us to “get a room.”   ~ Ron and Betsy</p>

                <p>“My husband and I are both scientists.  We have a busy life with work and two little kids. We weren’t getting along and it was just easier to avoid each other and focus on the kids or escape into our computers.  We probably could have gone on that way indefinitely but we suddenly had health crisis with one of our kids.  My husband became angry and withdrawn and I became a demanding control freak. Our son is fine now, thank goodness, but my husband and I really hurt each other in the process. By the time we found Nancy, we were barely speaking. Nancy showed us how to understand our responses to each other and how to repair our relationship so that we can be there for one another, even in a crisis.  We both say that we’ve never felt this close.  “Couples Counseling That Actually Works” really worked for us.  ~ Jennifer and Neal </p>

                <p>“When my wife and I first met Nancy, we were on the verge of getting divorced.  Working with her was pretty much a last ditch effort at saving our relationship. Nancy taught us to how to make emotion-based changes instead of just changing the way we act towards each other. With Nancy’s help we finally have the relationship we’ve always wanted. We would highly recommend Nancy to any couple who is thinking that getting divorced is their only option.”  ~ Marcus and Suzanne</p>

                <p>“When we were first dating, everything was new and exciting.  But the kind of excitement we have after working with Nancy is better.  Now it feels like the excitement is based in a deeper kind of love.  Of course it’s hard to compete with the sexual passion of when we first met, but believe it or not, the passion we have now actually tops that.  We are much more open and comfortable with each other.  Nancy is the best.” ~ Casey and Richard</p>
