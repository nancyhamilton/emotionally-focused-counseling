        <p>Do you remember when you and your spouse first fell in love?  Back when your relationship was in its prime? </p>
        <p>You:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>would do anything for one another;</li>
            <li>stayed up all night staring into each other’s eyes;</li>
            <li>made passionate love and</li>
            <li>basked in the support and confidence that you had finally found the person who “has your back?”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most of us remember all too well.  But then stress, kids, jobs, mortgages—you’re not sure<i> when</i> or even<i> how</i> you began feeling something missing.   But something happened to that wonderful bond...slowly and then all at once.</p>
        <p>Now you fight and never seem to resolve anything. You can’t remember the last time you had sex. You desperately seek your partner’s attention by nagging or criticizing or, trying not to make matters worse, by avoiding your partner all together.  Your kids hear you fighting and somehow<i> they</i> know your relationship is in trouble long before you can admit it to yourselves.</p>
        <p>The bottom line is your partner feels more like an enemy than a confidante and if it weren’t for the kids and the emotional and financial devastation of starting over, you would separate or divorce.</p>
        <p>You are not alone.</p>
        <p>Emotionally Focused Couples Counseling is a groundbreaking program for married couples (or couples in long-term, committed relationships) that are fighting or so distant that they are living like roommates) and desperately<strong> want more</strong> from their relationship. They want to stop fighting, renew their passion and thrive with each other once again (or maybe even for the first time) but don’t know how to get there.</p>
        <p>The good news is that transforming your relationship is not magic. It’s not about making behavioral changes such as having more date nights, becoming better listeners or learning to fight fair.</p>
        <p>The key to transforming your relationship begins with taking a look at your emotional connection. Being in sync with each other, feeling secure and facing the challenges of any relationship all depend on your ability to stay connected to each other emotionally. The good news is, we are all hard-wired for this connection…we just need help accessing it.</p>
        <p>Nancy Hamilton is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker has helped hundreds of couples just like you.  Her practice specialty is couples counseling. In addition to over 25 years of experience, she has received specialized training in the work of Sue Johnson, Ph.D., the pioneer of Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT).  EFT is rooted in psychological theory, brain science and over a quarter of a century of research. EFT is the only couple treatment program that has been shown to repair 90% of couples relationship distress in as few as 8 weeks.</p>
        <p>Using EFT, Nancy helps couples learn to respond to their partner more positively, stay engaged more consistently (even when partners disagree) and re-establish the emotional bond between them with more lasting effects.</p>
        <p>With Nancy’s help, couples de-escalate conflict, thaw emotional and physical distance, identify the negative “dance” in their partnership and address and heal the hurts that even the happiest couples experience.</p>
        <p>Nancy helps couples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a roadmap for shifting out of patterns that keep them stuck;</li>
            <li>Facilitate renewed trust;</li>
            <li>Deepen emotional and physical intimacy;</li>
          <li>Answer “YES” to the question<i> “are you there for me?”</i> despite the forces that tear relationships apart.</li>
        </ul>
