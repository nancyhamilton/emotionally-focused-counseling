        <p>Do you remember when you and your spouse first fell in love?  Back when your relationship was in its prime and you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>would do anything for one another;</li>
            <li>stayed up all night staring into each other’s eyes;</li>
            <li>made passionate love and</li>
            <li>basked in the support and confidence that you had finally found the person who “has your back?”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most of us remember all too well.  But then stress, kids, jobs, mortgages—you’re not sure when or even how you began feeling something missing.   But something happened to that wonderful bond...slowly and then all at once.</p>
        <p>Now you fight and never seem to resolve anything. You desperately seek your partner’s attention by nagging or criticizing or, trying not to make matters worse avoiding your partner all together.  Your kids hear you fighting and somehow they know your relationship is in trouble long before you can admit this to yourselves.</p>
        <p>The bottom line is your partner feels more like an enemy than a confidante and if it weren’t for the kids and the emotional and financial devastation of starting over, your relationship would be destined for separation or divorce.</p>
        <p>You are not alone.</p>
        <p>Emotionally Focused Couples Counseling is for married couples (or couples in long-term, committed relationships) who are fighting or so distant that they are living like roommates, and desperately want more from their relationship. These couples want to stop the fighting, renew their passion and thrive as a couple once again…or maybe even for the first time.</p>
        <p>Transforming a relationship is not magic. It’s <strong>not</strong> about making behavioral changes such as having more date nights, becoming better listeners or learning to fight fair.</p>
        <p>The key to transforming a relationship begins with an emotional connection. Being in sync with each other, feeling secure and facing the challenges any couple face all depend on the quality of the emotional connection with each other.</p>
        <p>The good news is, we as humans are all hard-wired for this connection; we just need help accessing it. Emotionally Focused Couples Counseling is based on psychological theory, brain science and over a quarter of a century of research.</p>
        <p>Nancy Hamilton is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker has helped hundreds of couples just like you.  Her practice specialty is couples counseling. She has received additional training in the work of Sue Johnson, Ph.D., the pioneer of Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT), the only couple treatment program that has been shown to repair relationship distress in over 90% of couples in as few as 8 weeks. EFT is based on psychological theory, brain science and over 25 years of research.</p>
        <p>Using EFT, Nancy helps couples learn to respond to their partner more positively, stay engaged more consistently (even when partners disagree) and re-establish the emotional bond between them with more lasting effects.</p>
        <p>With Nancy’s help, couples de-escalate conflict, thaw emotional and physical distance, identify the negative “dance” in their partnership and address and heal the hurts that even the happiest couples experience.</p>
        <p>Nancy helps couples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>create a roadmap for shifting out of patterns that keep them stuck;</li>
            <li>facilitate renewed trust;</li>
            <li>deepen emotional and physical intimacy;</li>
            <li>answer “YES” to the question “are you there for me?” despite the forces that tear relationships apart.</li>
        </ul>
